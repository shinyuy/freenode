                    freenode does not collect or log private or public chat. However, users may log their own chats
                    privately. Be careful about disclosing any personal information in a channel or private message

                <h3>COPPA DISCLOSURE - About Children’s Online Privacy</h3>
                <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed to give parents increased control
                    over what information is collected from their children online and how such information is used. The
                    law applies to websites and services directed to, and which knowingly collect information from,
                    children under the age of 13. Our online services are not directed to children under the age of 13,
                    nor is information knowingly collected from them. For additional information on COPPA protections,
                    please see the FTC website at:
