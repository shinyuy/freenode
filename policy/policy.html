                    default, freenode does not share your private information with any third parties aside from the
                    disclosures already made in this privacy policy. However, if you wish to inquire into how freenode

                <h3>MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>Your personal information is safeguarded by freenode. You may access your personal information
                    maintained by freenode via a services command (/msg nickserv info ). Personal information stored by

                <h3>COPPA DISCLOSURE - About Children’s Online Privacy</h3>
                <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed to give parents increased control
                    over what information is collected from their children online and how such information is used. The
                    law applies to websites and services directed to, and which knowingly collect information from,
                    children under the age of 13. Our online services are not directed to children under the age of 13,
                    nor is information knowingly collected from them. For additional information on COPPA protections,
                    please see the FTC website at:
                    https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online</p>

                </p>

                <h3>HOW TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
